This section is meant for users who are installing Voyager on an already existing Laravel installation or for users who want to perform a manual install. If this is not the case, you should go back to the installation documentation or skip this section.

The first thing you should do is publish the assets that come with Voyager. You can do that by running the following commands:

Shell
 Copy
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider=VoyagerServiceProvider
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider=ImageServiceProviderLaravel5
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider=VoyagerServiceProvider
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider=ImageServiceProviderLaravel5
