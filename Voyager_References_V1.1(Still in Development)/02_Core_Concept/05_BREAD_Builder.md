SUGGEST EDITS
When adding or editing the current BREAD for a database table you will first see the BREAD info which allows you to set the Display Names, slug, icon, Model and Controller Namespace, Policy Name. You can also choose if you would like to Generate permissions for that BREAD type.


When you scroll down you will see each of the rows that are associated with that table where you can select where in your views you want to see each of those fields:

BROWSE (field will show up when you browse the current data)
READ (field will show when you click to view the current data)
EDIT (field will be visible and allow you to edit the data)
ADD (field will be visible when you choose to create a new data type)
DELETE (doesn't pertain to delete so this can be checked or unchecked)

You may also choose to specify what form type you want to use for each field. This can be a TextBox, TextArea, Checkbox, Image, and many other types of form elements.

Each field also has additional details or options that can be included. These types are checkbox, dropdown, radio button, and image.
